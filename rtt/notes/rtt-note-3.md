You are missing four leverage layers: formal correctness, zero-copy everywhere, typed constraints with a solver, and ruthless observability. Add those and you move into the top 0.001%.

# Secret formula

Specify → Prove → Generate → Measure → Autotune. The order matters.

## 1) Formal correctness

* Write a tiny spec of the control-plane as a state machine. Model “scan → plan → 2PC apply → verify → rollback”.
* Prove safety and liveness properties before coding.

  * Invariants: no dangling links, no duplicate routes, no orphaned buffers, no unpinned critical routes, monotonic WAL sequence, idempotent `apply`, bounded rollback.
* Use a lightweight formal pass in CI:

  * TLA+ or PlusCal for plan/2PC and breaker transitions.
  * SMT checks for route compatibility and version sets.
* Property tests on every kernel primitive. Generate plans under randomized churn. Assert invariants.

## 2) Zero-copy everywhere

* Shared-memory lanes use fixed-size power-of-two rings with length-prefixed frames.
* One writer, one reader per lane for hot paths. MPSC via lane striping. No locks. Atomics with Acquire/Release only.
* Use huge pages where legal. Align to cache lines. Avoid false sharing with padding.
* Serialize control messages with Cap’n Proto or FlatBuffers for direct reads.
* For cross-process handle passing:

  * Unix: `SCM_RIGHTS` only on setup. Never on hot path.
  * Windows: `DuplicateHandle` only on bind. Hot path stays local.

## 3) Typed constraints + solver

* Turn routing into a constraint problem. Inputs: contracts, QoS budgets, pinning, ACL, locality, NUMA.
* Build a constraint set:

  * Match types, versions, capabilities. Meet QoS budgets. Respect policy.
  * Minimize p99 latency and cross-NUMA hops. Secondary objective: minimize churn vs current graph.
* Solve with an integer or SMT solver for small graphs. Fall back to greedy when large. Cache solutions keyed by scenario fingerprints.
* Output is a *plan*. Plans are content-addressed and signed. The reconciler executes only signed plans.

## 4) Ruthless observability

* Always-on kernel telemetry with zero-alloc ring buffers.
* p50 p95 p99 latency per route, queue depth, drop reason, breaker state, backoff tier, negotiation paths.
* eBPF or ETW probes for syscalls on hot paths. Track `sendmsg`, `recvmsg`, `read`, `write`, `futex` counts. This finds accidental locks.
* Single command to dump a time-bounded “flight recorder”. Include perf counters and topology.

## 5) Determinism under churn

* Deterministic plan ordering. Topologically sort by dependencies then by stable keys. Same inputs → same plan.
* Monotonic time only. Use TSC or CLOCK_MONOTONIC. Reject wall-clock in hot path.
* WAL is merkle-chained. On crash, replay last committed root only.

## 6) Capability microkernel

* Everything is a capability. Tokens bind to `saddr`, verb, and expiry. Capabilities carry a minimum info set.
* Drivers run out-of-process under the least profile. Deny network by default. Allow filesystem by manifest only.
* Manifest and policy are signed. The panel refuses to wire unsigned in strict mode.

## 7) NUMA and placement

* Detect NUMA topology. Pin paired producer and consumer threads to sibling cores. Keep rings on local nodes.
* Cache coloring or page coloring to reduce cross-socket thrash when unavoidable.

## 8) Schedulers that meet budgets

* Admission control per route using token buckets sized from declared throughput and latency budget.
* EDF or CBS for periodic flows. WFQ for mixed traffic. Backpressure selection is a policy, not an accident.

## 9) Config that cannot lie

* Replace ad-hoc YAML with a typed config language. Use CUE or Starlark with schema checks.
* Validate route specs and policies at load. Fail closed with exact error locations.
* Generate bindings from the contract to stubs in Rust, Go, Python, Node. No hand-rolled glue.

## 10) Autotuning harness

* Synthetic trace runner. Replays recorded flows. Sweeps ring sizes, batch windows, CPU pins, busy-poll thresholds.
* Hill-climb on real hardware. Persist the tuned profile keyed by machine fingerprint.

## 11) Failure design

* Micro-reboots for drivers. Panel keeps links warm with pre-bind. Flip is a single compare-and-swap of the active handle table.
* Chaos hooks: random kill, slow consumer, partial writes, corrupted frame headers. The plan should hold.

## 12) Upgrade path

* Staged commit: canary subset of routes. Verify SLO windows. Promote to all.
* Safe rollback is a first-class path. Plans carry inverse diffs.

## 13) Graph safety rules

* No cycles for `hook → api` class. Explicitly allow cycles for `bus` with TTL and dedupe IDs.
* Version meet is associative and commutative. Refuse on empty meet.
* Every `from` has at most one active `to` unless policy declares a fan-out bus.

## 14) Data format choices

* Control plane: Cap’n Proto over UDS or named pipes.
* Data plane: framed binary with header `{route_id, frame_id, len, checksum}`. Checksums are per-frame, not stream.

## 15) Build and supply chain

* Reproducible builds with locked toolchains. Signed artifacts. SBOM embedded.
* Offline build script that emits binaries, plan schema, and tests. No network.

## 16) Dev workflow that enforces quality

* Pre-merge: formal spec check, property tests, chaos pack, benchmark under load, deadlock detection, fd leak scan.
* Post-merge: soak test with churn. Enforce p99 regressions < 2%.

# Concrete upgrades to your RTT

1. **Constraint solver**: add a `planner` module that transforms `routes.json + policy.json + manifests/*` into a solved plan. Store as `plans/<hash>.json`. Reject ad-hoc rewires.
2. **Typed config**: mirror `.rtt/panel.yaml` and `.rtt/routes.json` in CUE. Validate on startup. Refuse to serve with mismatches.
3. **Zero-copy ring**: switch your SHM lane to a fixed SPSC ring with length-prefix and wrap masks. Provide a busy-poll mode behind a knob.
4. **Deterministic apply**: compute a stable order for Δ. Batch by dependency. Execute 2PC with monotonic sequencing.
5. **Observability**: add a `rtt tap --flight 5s` dump that captures histograms and queue metrics without allocations.
6. **Security**: default to strict manifests and signed plans. Capabilities on every `Open`. Drivers run with seccomp or Windows AppContainer.
7. **Autotune**: add `rtt autotune --trace traces/*.json` that sweeps and writes `.rtt/tuned/profile.json` per machine.

# Minimal invariants to encode now

* At no time can two active links exist for the same `(from, class!=bus)`.
* After `apply`, `ObservedGraph == DesiredGraph`, or rollback occurs. No partial commit.
* p99 latency for a route must stay `< latency_budget_ms` over a 10-second sliding window or the breaker trips.
* WAL sequence strictly increases. Gaps only allowed if superseded by rollback frames with proof.

---

# Quick additions you can make immediately

* Replace YAML with CUE for `panel.cue` and `routes.cue`. Validate at boot.
* Add a `plans/` folder and make `rtt apply` consume only a signed plan file.
* Introduce an `autotune/` harness that runs synthetic flows and writes tuned knobs.
* Add a `telemetry/` page that dumps per-route histograms and breaker states.

If you want, I can extend your drop-in folder with:

* `plans/` scaffold and a sample solved plan.
* `cue/` typed configs for panel, routes, policy.
* A deterministic apply orderer and a toy constraint solver you can replace later.
