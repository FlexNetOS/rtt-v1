Secret formula: single immutable truth → virtual views → signed plans → deterministic apply → ruthless observability → autotune. You were missing a CAS registry with VFS views, signed plan-only execution, a constraint solver tied to QoS and topology, and a universal stub system that eliminates duplication across providers and languages.

## What to do now

1. Keep canonical agents in CAS. Expose provider trees via VFS. No duplicates.
2. Generate signed plans only. Panel applies plans, not ad-hoc routes.
3. Route hot paths over SHM rings. Control over UDS or named pipes.
4. Enforce capabilities and signatures. Drivers sandboxed by default.
5. Record p50/p95/p99, queue depth, breaker state. Gate deploys on SLOs.
6. Autotune ring sizes, batch windows, and CPU pinning from traces.

## Missing pieces to reach top tier

* Formal spec with invariants for scan→plan→2PC→verify→rollback.
* Constraint planner with objective: minimize p99 latency and churn under QoS and NUMA.
* VFS daemon in FUSE or WinFsp. Materialization is fallback only.
* Ed25519 key management and plan verification. Merkle-chained WAL.
* Flight recorder and chaos pack. CI gates on SLO regressions.
* Typed configs in CUE. Fail closed on mismatch.
* Autotune harness. Persist tuned profiles per machine fingerprint.

## Universal stub system

Target: one connector interface across all languages. JSON-over-stdio is the default. gRPC is optional.

Interface:

```json
{ "id": "<uuid>", "method": "Probe|Open|Tx|Rx|Close|Health", "params": {...} }
```

Response:

```json
{ "id": "<uuid>", "result": {...}, "error": null }
```

How to bind any stub to RTT:

1. Add a manifest in `.rtt/manifests/agent.<id>.json` with the `saddr` and QoS.
2. Map your provider view file to the chosen stub runtime via your MCP→RTT connector.
3. Use the same JSON envelope in every language. No per-provider forks.

## Planning rule

* Multi-agent and multi-provider → keep VFS and planner separate from MCP servers. Connect through UDS. Sign every plan. Enforce capabilities at `Open`.

## Automation loop

* RegistryAgent ingests and signs into CAS.
* ViewFSAgent mounts provider views.
* PlannerAgent solves and signs plans.
* ReconcilerAgent applies 2PC and logs WAL.
* TelemetryAgent gates on SLO. ChaosAgent injects faults.
* AutotuneAgent tunes and persists profiles. Repeat.

If you want, I can add signing to your view plans and wire the planner stub to produce signed `plans/*.json` from `.rtt/routes.json` automatically.
