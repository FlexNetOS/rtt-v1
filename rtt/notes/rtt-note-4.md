Short answer: you’re missing four things that top builders converge on in 2025: zero-copy I/O paths end-to-end, typed contracts with attestations, policy-gated orchestration with strict admission control, and unified observability. Everything else hangs off those.

# What the current landscape says (Oct 2025)

* **MCP as the common tool bus.** The June 2025 spec hardens auth and structured output; roadmap prioritizes security, validation, registry, and multimodality. Windows is shipping native MCP support. Treat MCP servers as first-class endpoints in your relay. ([Model Context Protocol][1])
* **Realtime is moving to WebRTC/QUIC for voice and low-latency tool use.** OpenAI Realtime API is GA with WebRTC, SIP calling, and remote MCP servers. Favor mediated WebRTC over raw WebSockets for production latency and key hygiene. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
* **Model gateways are now standard.** LiteLLM and OpenRouter provide routing, fallbacks, budgets, and cost tracking behind an OpenAI-compatible API. Your relay should speak “gateway” natively. ([LiteLLM][3])
* **Observability is standardizing.** OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions define spans, metrics, and events for LLMs and agents; OpenInference is widely used but must align with OTel. Instrument the relay at the agent, tool, and model span levels. ([OpenTelemetry][4])
* **Zero-copy primitives matter.** FUSE adds kernel round-trips; pair it with shared-memory fast paths: `io_uring`, `memfd_create` + `mmap`, FD-passing over UDS (`SCM_RIGHTS`). Use WebRTC/QUIC for network legs. ([Portkey][5])
* **Contracts are getting typed and portable.** JSON-Schema strict outputs, tool schemas, and IDLs like Smithy are the new baseline. ([OpenAI][6])
* **Supply-chain proofs are table stakes.** SLSA + in-toto attestations and OCI-native signatures verify artifacts and plans. ([SLSA][7])
* **CAS everywhere.** Lean on Nix/Bazel CAS concepts for addressing, dedupe, and reproducibility. ([nix.dev][8])
* **WASM components are maturing.** The Component Model and WASI 0.3 add async I/O; good for portable quick-connect plug-ins behind strict capabilities. ([WASI][9])

# The “secret formula” the top 0.001% use

1. **Zero-copy first design.**

   * Local path: SHM rings via `memfd_create` → pass FDs with `SCM_RIGHTS` → single copy into user buffers. Avoid FUSE for hot paths; keep it for namespace and cold data. ([Liujunming][10])
   * Network path: QUIC/WebRTC with per-stream prioritization; keep TCP/WebSockets as a compatibility lane. ([OpenAI Platform][2])

2. **Typed contracts with attestations.**

   * Tool and API schemas as **authoritative** (JSON-Schema/Smithy). Enforce with provider structured-output features. Stamp each symbol and plan with in-toto/SLSA attestations. ([OpenAI][6])

3. **Plan→Act gates.**

   * Before plan expansion or execution, run an **invariant check**: inputs available, quotas budgeted, policy allowed, and placement feasible. If any fail, short-circuit. This eliminates most bad cascades and human approvals.

4. **Admission control + placement as math.**

   * Global token buckets + GCRA for rate and burst control; WFQ/Codel-like queues for fairness and tail-latency. Solve placement with constraints (cost, SLO, region, data-residency, warm cache) before admission. ([Wikipedia][11])

5. **Unified traces and budgets.**

   * Emit OTel GenAI spans for every tool call, function call, retrieval, and model hop; measure TTFT and time-per-token; enforce **budget caps** per request and per tenant. ([OpenTelemetry][12])

# What you’re missing in your relay terminal

* **Fast path IPC:** SHM ring buffers with `memfd` + batched FD passing; reserve FUSE/WinFsp for mount exposure only. ([Codemia][13])
* **Dual-lane transport:** WebRTC/QUIC for realtime audio/video/tools; HTTP/1.1+3 for bulk and control. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
* **Contract authority:** one schema source of truth (Smithy or JSON-Schema) with generated stubs for all languages, and **strict** structured outputs at the LLM boundary. ([OpenAI][6])
* **Proof-carrying plans:** in-toto/SLSA attestations for `.rtt` manifests and execution transcripts; verify before admission. ([in-toto][14])
* **Gateway integration:** first-class drivers for LiteLLM/OpenRouter so “model” is a **logical** name with routing, quotas, cost caps, and fallbacks. ([LiteLLM][3])
* **OTel-native telemetry:** emit GenAI spans + metrics (TTFT, time-per-token, tool latency) and attach plan/manifold IDs for replay. ([OpenTelemetry][12])
* **WASM quick-connects:** optional plug-ins in WASI component form for safe, portable execution with capability scoping. ([WASI][9])

# Concrete upgrades to your design

**1) Low-latency I/O path**

* Implement SHM lane: `memfd_create` → `mmap` → UDS control channel with `SCM_RIGHTS` for FD passing; batch descriptors. Keep a mirrored API lane over WebRTC for cross-host and voice. ([Liujunming][10])

**2) Contracts + codegen**

* Define symbols/tools in Smithy or JSON-Schema. Generate stubs for Rust, Go, Python, TS. Enforce strict structured outputs at the LLM edge. ([Smithy][15])

**3) Attested execution**

* Produce and verify in-toto attestations for every plan and artifact; store as OCI refs with Sigstore/Cosign in your CAS. Gate execution on verification. ([GitHub Docs][16])

**4) Admission control**

* Per-tenant token buckets + GCRA policing; WFQ for fairness; hard budget checks before tool calls. Shed load instead of queuing when budgets or SLOs would be violated. ([Wikipedia][11])

**5) Placement + churn optimizer**

* Pre-warm pools by demand forecasts. Solve for latency+cost under data-residency constraints. Keep a decay-based cache eviction to limit churn.

**6) Observability**

* Adopt OTel GenAI semconv; record TTFT, time-per-token, and tool spans. Export to your APM. ([OpenTelemetry][4])

**7) Gateway-aware relay**

* Native drivers for LiteLLM/OpenRouter with policy hooks for routing, failover, rate/ spend budgets, and model-capability labels. ([LiteLLM][3])

**8) MCP everywhere**

* Treat MCP servers as first-class connectors. Support remote MCP via Realtime. Use the spec’s latest auth guidance. ([Model Context Protocol][1])

# Balancing FUSE and quick-connect

* **Strategy:** mount VFS for namespace, discovery, and cold reads; auto-escalate hot flows to SHM/WebRTC lanes on first hot-spot detection. Keep FUSE only as a control plane. ([Portkey][5])

# “SMLL” to replace human-in-the-loop

Interpret as **small specialist models** used as judges, routers, and safety sentinels. Wire them as cheap sidecars behind strict contracts and admission control. Use structured outputs and policy gates to avoid human approvals except for escalations. ([OpenTelemetry][4])

# End-to-end automation loop

1. **Invariant gate** (availability, policy, budget, placement).
2. **Plan** with typed constraints.
3. **Attest** plan and inputs.
4. **Admit** via token bucket/GCRA, then **execute** on SHM/WebRTC fast paths.
5. **Observe** with OTel; enforce budget and SLO guards; auto-rollback on invariant drift. ([Wikipedia][11])

If you implement the above, you get the real advantages the elite rely on: microsecond-level local hops, provable contracts, predictable cost and latency, and automation that rarely needs a human.
