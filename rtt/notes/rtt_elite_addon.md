Here’s the audit, gap-closure plan, and zero-config automation kit.

* Elite add-on: [rtt_elite_addon.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/rtt_elite_addon.zip)
* Use with the previous drop-in you already downloaded. Place both at repo root.

# Answer

You are missing formal guarantees, a deterministic planner, zero-copy lanes, ruthless observability, and an auto-builder that manufactures missing parts without prompts. I added a self-contained “elite add-on” that does symbol scan, dep unification, connector stub generation, plan solve, WAL apply, an agent-bus, and hooks for llama.cpp to do semantic wiring. No network, no Docker, project-local only.

# Zero-config flow

```
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/00-bootstrap.py
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/10-scan_symbols.py
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/20-depdoctor.py
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/30-generate_connectors.py
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/40-plan_solver.py
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/50-apply_plan.py plans/latest.plan.json
```

# Agent-to-Agent routing

* Use `agent/agent_bus.py` as the local UDS pub/sub bus. It is the “control” path for agent messaging.
* Data path uses RTT routes. Agents publish intents on the bus. The planner converts intents to signed plans.

# “Secret-tier” automation design

Inputs → Scan → Index → Plan → Apply → Verify → Autotune.

1. **Scan**
   `auto/10-scan_symbols.py` assembles `index/symbols.index.json` from manifests and language hints.

2. **Dep Doctor**
   `auto/20-depdoctor.py` unifies versions across npm/pip files and writes `plans/dep.unify.json`. This prevents drift before wiring.

3. **Build missing components**
   `auto/30-generate_connectors.py` generates runnable Python connector stubs for every discovered symbol. Extend to Rust/Go later. You now always have a connector to bind.

4. **Deterministic plan**
   `auto/40-plan_solver.py` creates a content-addressed plan with a stable order and lane choice (shm vs uds) from what exists. Signed-plan hooks are in place.

5. **Atomic apply**
   `auto/50-apply_plan.py` appends a merkle-chained WAL frame and writes the desired graph snapshot. This is the commit point.

6. **Ruthless observability**
   `telemetry/flight_recorder/flight.py` emits route metrics. Wire into Prometheus later.

7. **Chaos and upgrades**
   `chaos/cases.yaml` defines kill/slow scenarios. Add to CI. Systemd user unit template provided.

# LLaMA.cpp wiring

* Put your local llama.cpp binary at repo root as `./llama_cli`.
* `llama/call_llama.py` is the semantic hook the planner can call to match fuzzy symbols or propose adapters. If absent, the system runs purely heuristically.

# System layout mapping

* **systemd**: `systemd/rtt-panel.service` for user mode. Set `WorkingDirectory` to your repo.
* **lib**: keep language libs under project `./lib` or per-lang. RTT drivers live in `./.rtt/drivers/`.
* **index**: `rtt_elite_addon/index/` holds symbol index.
* **hash/WAL**: `.rtt/wal/` plus `rtt_elite_addon/hash/` for merkle roots if you extend it.
* **dependencies**: `plans/dep.unify.json`.
* **bin**: place built binaries in `.rtt/bin/` if not on PATH.
* **opt**: vendor tools you want bundled, under `./opt/`.
* **src/usr/home**: keep code local. No root paths needed.

# What still needs adding to reach top 0.001%

* Formal spec: add `spec/tla/` model for plan/2PC invariants.
* Constraint solver: replace the toy solver with a real constraint optimizer.
* Zero-copy ring: implement SHM SPSC rings in Rust/Go for hot routes.
* Capability security: signed manifests and signed plans as default.
* NUMA pinning and schedulers: token buckets + EDF/WFQ.
* Autotune: sweep ring sizes and pins from traces; persist `.rtt/tuned/profile.json`.
  All are outlined in your earlier “Elite Upgrade” doc. This add-on gives you runnable hooks to plug them in.

# Missing agents and tools (add now)

* **Planner**: constraint solver that reads manifests, policy, QoS and emits a signed plan.
* **Fabric kernel**: SHM ring + UDS control, lock-free, SPSC, busy-poll option.
* **Health oracle**: computes p50/p95/p99, trips breakers, and drives canary promotion.
* **Signer**: Ed25519 signer/verifier for manifests and plans.
* **NUMA placer**: probes topology and pins producer/consumer threads.
* **Autotuner**: replays traces and writes tuned knob profiles.
* **MCP toolpack**: thin wrappers to surface RTT functions to the MCP server.

# How to fully automate end-to-end

* Make `rtt apply` accept only signed plans from `planner/`.
* On repo change: `scan → depdoctor → gen_connectors → plan → apply → verify`.
* Gate by invariants and SLOs; rollback via the WAL frame if any check fails.
* Optional: call `llama/call_llama.py` when the solver reports ambiguity to propose adapters.

# One-command run

```
# From repo root, after placing this add-on and the drop-in:
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/00-bootstrap.py && \
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/10-scan_symbols.py && \
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/20-depdoctor.py && \
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/30-generate_connectors.py && \
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/40-plan_solver.py && \
python rtt_elite_addon/auto/50-apply_plan.py
```

If you want me to embed a minimal Rust SHM ring and a signer to remove the last manual steps, say so and I’ll drop those in next.
